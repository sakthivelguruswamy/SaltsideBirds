# SaltsideBirds
My code exercise from saltside

Used jackson for json and java object conversion.
Used Tomcat 8 for running the application.

code improvements that can be done:
1) My code exercise lacks test suite and I used BirdsDAO.main method to populate the required data, all DAO level API's are called from the main method and service level API's are tested from browser.
2) Exception handling is only at basic level of WriteResult and has to be modified based on the various states of WriteResult.
